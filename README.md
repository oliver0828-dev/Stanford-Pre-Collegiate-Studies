# Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies
## Introduction to Data Science

### Course Synopsis (From Stanford University)
This course is intended for advanced high school students who wish to further their understanding of current methods models and tools within the R programming language and apply these to investigating scientific questions using data. No specific previous classes are required as prerequisites but some basic understanding of statistics or computer programming is a plus. Data science has revolutionized the way our world works and how we understand it. Technology enables us to ask more questions of more data, but how do we go about using these tools effectively and ethically?

This course will introduce students to computer algorithms and the diversity of models they can generate, each with pros and cons. Students will use datasets from the natural and social sciences to answer real- world questions, pursuing questions and data relevant to their own lives. They will apply different facets of machine learning through R programming exercises deeply integrated into the course. By the end of the course, students will have developed a technical skill set that allows them to investigate any given dataset with strong coding abilities and a scientific approach.

### Learning Objectives (From Stanford University)
Gain practical knowledge for using statistics, machine learning and AI models
